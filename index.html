          <h3 class="post-title">Without a signature: Identity & Bitcoin</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I finally got around to watching <em>Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World</em> on Hulu. It’s broadly about the evolution of the internet. One of the things that struck me was a mother’s account of her daughter’s death at the hands of a self-driving vehicle. The mother then expressed that she believed the internet to be a manifestation of the devil or the Antichrist, due to her personal negative experiences of receiving hate mail about her daughters death. “On the internet, anyone can say whatever they want with no consequences” she expressed. And she’s right. This is a problem for those who don’t desire to be exposed to such content. While it can be argued that privacy in our expression allows for a broader range of creativity, the only ethical solution to combatting hate speech is the existence of a platform in which users possess a verifiable identity where they are held socially accountable for things they say. A cryptographically secure decentralized identity system would do wonders for society, and would allow for scalable growth of the internet of value.
            </p>
            <p>I imagine a digital identity would look a lot like a digital wallet, which is also similar to a browsing cookie in a way. Essentially a wallet and a cookie both allow for quick verification that you are you. A wallet however allows for transactions of cryptocurrency in the browser. A digital identity would open up new possibilities like built-in credit scores for taking out loans in seconds, and would allow for new types of social networks to exist online that better emulate the economic/political system. For instance, a decentralized social network may be able to effectively guarantee that users possess a single democratic vote on a change to the social network’s governance. But without a verifiable ID, people can create multiple accounts and thus vote on things multiple times. One project to look out for is being built on the EOS blockchain, called <a href="https://app.voice.com/"><em>Voice</em></a>.
            </p>
            <p>We have to be careful that an identification system is not too centralized however, or it will end up looking like the federal reserve does today; overrun by criminals that steal from the American people by “printing” or expanding the supply of dollars. Centralized systems contain too many points of failure, and thus greed corrupts them.
            </p>
            <p>Recently Bill Gates has come under fire for suggesting something along the lines of a digital identity, to which it is confirmed Microsoft is working on with a number of notable crypto people. There have been smaller identity products circulating the web today, and it will be interesting to see what competitors arise in the digital identity space, as a monopoly would surely be a disappointment. Furthermore, I hope Microsoft and other big tech companies actually have the integrity to create an identity product that is not centralized and truly gives power to people, though we know they have a history of trying to achieve world domination.
            </p>
            <p>In some respect, that woman was right about an evil entity being manifested by the internet. De-platforming and censorship are both reflections of overreaching powers attempting to control the narrative, but hate speech is also an issue. The internet of information is an ugly place, but we have the opportunity to make it better through well-scaled blockchains and their immutability. Giving tokenized value to data could allow for a more accurate representation of what is truly valuable to society.
            </p>
            <p>In a recent interview with Lex Fridman, Jack Dorsey called Bitcoin a “total activist move”. To those unfamiliar with the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, it is suspected to be an individual, though it’s more likely a group of people who never took credit for their creation. The oddity is that while no one took credit for creating bitcoin, the underlying blockchain technology created a reliable way for artists to guarantee credit for their own unique creation. Bitcoin itself is poetic. If you have time to kill, watch the film <a href=“https://youtu.be/gIVgUjj6RxU”><em>F for Fake (1973)</em></a> by Orson Welles (Citizen Kane). It lays out the double spending problem and seems to parallel a bitcoin-like solution. Specifically, there’s a climactic, though quiet scene that displays the Chartres Cathedral. Narrating, Welles refers to it as “the premier work of man, perhaps in the whole western world, and it is without a signature.”

          <h3 class="post-title">The state of the State: Why crypto isn't crazy</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>“It’s our currency” President Trump said on March 24, 2020 in a Coronavirus briefing. As the virus sweeps the nation, it’s possible that the age old argument of whether the Federal Reserve is an independent entity is being tested.
            </p>
            <p>As expressed in our textbook, financial innovations have typically been developed to skirt regulations and restrictions that put a damper on profitability. Similarly, when a currency is experiencing hyperinflation, innovation will evolve outside of that constraint. Additionally, the anti-capitalistic, too-big-to-fail policy has raised moral hazard among corporations with massive debt because they are expecting a bailout. Meanwhile, these corporations outsource most manufacturing to foreign countries, and so the value that was initially taken from the American people leaves the country entirely. “The Cantillon Effect” describes this phenomenon of theft through localized inflation very well. It is because the money supply has a specific injection point and specific flow path through the economy that wealth inequality is so rampant. It seems a decentralized currency is more important than ever to combat this wealth inequality.
            </p>
            <p>A far better approach to providing security to the American people throughout this pandemic would be to give money directly to consumers and let capitalism play out in free market form. The long term benefits of this scenario far outweigh the benefits of the current method of providing stimulus to corporations that supply politicians with campaign funding. The question that’s been raised for scenario 2 is “How do we get funds to people in a reasonable timeframe?”
            </p>
            <p>There have been a number of ideas floating around to solve this issue. The first proposed by Congressional democrats was to issue a “digital dollar” along with “digital wallets” that operate on a “digital ledger”. The second rumor was that the Federal Reserve would partner with Coinbase; an instant borderless payment provider with their own ‘USDC’ cryptocurrency pegged to price of USD. Lastly, news is now circulating that funds could be issued via a joint agreement between Square’s Cash App and payment provider, Venmo.
            </p>
            <p>All the while, the price of metals like gold are on the rise. However, gold and other metals are tied to the means of production. Increased demand for scarce metals increases manufacturing costs for things like arms and electronics. As a result, the end consumer sees the prices of these goods rise, and thus the standard of living decreases.
            </p>
            <p>While the Federal Reserve continues to inject stimulus and raise the money supply at an alarming rate, consumers are looking for safe haven assets. As a finite asset, real estate may be the safest investment of all, but for obvious reasons, real estate cannot function as a medium of exchange.
            </p>
            <p>So now the question is; is the infrastructure in place for digital payments? Guaranteed internet access and renewable sources of energy are two components needed for this utopia. The first needed component is being developed right now. SpaceX’s Star Link Satellite Internet Service will provide internet access globally within the next 6 months to a year, and more competitors are entering the space race. This valuable infrastructure will allow for the security needed for digital payments to become a reality. It seems large tech companies are preparing for this reality as well, as the third largest tech company, Microsoft, filed a patent this week for a “cryptocurrency system using body activity data” [1].
            </p>
            <p>Whether or not these changes spell the end for fiat currencies, it is certain that using a scaled blockchain is the most ethical way to go about consumer data management. The article The Rise of the Invisible Bank gives us a surveillance state scenario in which “You walk in, we know where you are, where you entered, on which train you stepped in and where you stepped out, and you’re charged for your trip automatically,” Legrand said. “This is what you want.” While this is indeed what the consumer wants from an effort standpoint, personal data should be a property right. Even though using public services does not subject the user to immunity of data gathering, a line must be drawn so as not to take advantage of the rights of consumers through debilitating over-surveillance.
            </p>
            <p>And so, blockchain will play a massive role in neutralizing the surveillance state though the encryption of data and the algorithmic execution of that data without human involvement. Details aside, the future of money is programmable, and it’s a fair assumption that most of of the banking industry will eventually be dominated by programming as well.

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>In the Fall of 2019, I had the humble experience of being in an assigned group of intelligent MBA students who were forward thinking on virtual technologies. Together, we brought an idea to a marketable concept and created a marketing plan to launch our product. The concept is an application of wearables like Google Glass, Microsoft Hololens, and the anticipated Apple Glasses. Currently, language conversion and/or translation technologies is a growing field, with Google’s Pixel Buds now providing a speech translation feature. However, deaf and/or hard-of-hearing people have no realistic use for audio based technologies. Our idea started simple; use machine learning to make sign language understandable to anyone via wearable technology. Hand tracking and eye tracking were the main ways this would be done.
            </p>
            <p>My duties were graphic design and the Strategic Initiatives portion of research and presentation. As we progressed with the project, some innovative user experience ideas blossomed.

          <h3 class="post-title">What music means to me</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I have been casually writing and producing music with a guitar since I was around 17 years old. Admittedly, it has never been any “good”, but the subjective nature of music has allowed me to enjoy the practice of it rather than the end result. Project scaling was always the end goal, and I have been able to scale my songs from start to completion to about a 2-3 hour timeframe with sonic consistency. To listen; follow this <a href="https://0xtom.bandcamp.com/">link</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Digital music production has taught me many things about programming, including file management, data compression, inputs/outputs, signal flow, templating, and interfaces. Analog production has taught me about the difference between analog and digital signals, analog’s limitations, and it has also expanded my appreciation for analog works and instrumental skill. Oldies are goodies.
            </p>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve worked to develop my skills with a guitar to make the creative experience of music more self-expressive, and the end result more human. Guitar is something I must do daily, otherwise my brain will not work as desired. When you look at your playing hand on the strings and try to formulate combinations that stay within the bounds of a key, you realize that it is very similar to programming on a computer. Music theory, after all, is a language, and like any programming language (Javascript, C++, Python, etc.), it can be learned by all. The expressive nature of playing an instrument makes the experience worthwhile, and certainly runs parallel with typing on a keyboard. Furthermore, the bounds you create for your expressive creativity allow for the completion of tasks, and is the main driver of the quality of the result. Through playing guitar, I’ve been able to apply the same programmatic thinking to virtually every part of my life. The experience of music, for me, was always about discovery.

            <p>Brand design has always been a natural output for me. It is what spurred my initial interest in graphic design. Below are some of the conceptual designs I have developed over the years.

            <p>Nocoma, 2017 - The name meant, North Country, ME / MA, and was a clothing brand I was developing with a few whitewater rafting friends. However, it wasn’t until later that we discovered the name “Nocoma” was the Native American God of Creation for a tribe in the Southwest United States. And so, we felt it was not ethically sound, so we dropped the project.
